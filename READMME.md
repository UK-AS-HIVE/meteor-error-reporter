Currently this serves only as a proof of concept.

To-do:

1. Store Errors in an Error collection as well as send an email (or any kind of notification) when unhandled errors occur.
2. Allow user to add information on how to replicate the error
3. Add a feedback button that allows user to enter feedback

Extra feautures to-do:
1. Monitor connection to the server and display message if client gets disconnected, as well as when client reconnects.
2. Write tests to ensure package never breaks.
